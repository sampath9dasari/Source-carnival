The maximum duration for round 1 will be 5 minutes and that of round 2 will be 10 min. Any team that is not ready at the time specified will be disqualified from the competition.

Judges' decision shall be treated as final and the organizers reserve the rights to change any or all of the above rules as they deem fit.  Violation of any the above rules will lead to disqualification.  Change in rules(if any), will be highlighted on the website and notified to the registered teams. Safety Rules: 1. Compliance with all event rules is mandatory. It is expected that competitors stay within the rules and procedures of their own accord and do not require constant policing. 2. If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the categories set forth in these rules or is in some way ambiguous or borderline, please contact the event organizers. 3. All weapons must have a safety cover on any sharp edges",

A bot with one side of its drive train disabled will not be counted out if it can demonstrate some degree of controlled movement. 3). If both robots survive the three minutes, the robot with the higher hit points wins. 4.) The winner moves on and the loser is eliminated from the tournament.",

After entering the Arena both the Bots will clash. There will be a specific time limit for the Clash. The winners will move to the next round. ROUND 2: This is the deciding round. The bots are directly placed in the fighting zone. At the arena, the bots will be having sufficient time for the clash. The winner will be based on the time factor and the clash. Arena will be disclosed at the time of this round NOTE: Both rounds will be having different Arenas. Team Specification: A team may consist of a maximum of 4 participants.",

Length and width is measured to the extremities of the Robot, i.e. includes any overhanging bodywork, weaponry or protrusions. The external device used to control the bot is not included in the size constraint. Mobility: All bots must have easily visible and controlled mobility in order to compete. Methods of mobility include: Rolling (wheels, tracks or the whole robot). Jumping and hopping is not allowed. Flying (using air foil, helium balloons, ornithopters, etc.) is not allowed. Robot Control Requirements: If the bot is wired then the wire should remain slack under all circumstances during the competition. All the wires coming out of the bot should be stacked as a single unit. The wires should be properly insulated. Teams are suggested to use only rated wires such as ISI marked. Loose connections or improper wiring may lead to direct disqualification even before the event.If the bot is controlled wirelessly, the bot must at least have a four frequency remote control circuit or two dual control circuits which may be interchanged before the start of the race to avoid frequency interference with other teams. Cases of any interference in the wireless systems will not be considered forrematch. Remote control systems from toys may be used. Remote control systems available in the market may also be used. Battery and POWER: The machine can be powered electrically only. Batteries must be sealed and immobilized- electrolyte types (such as Li-ion, NiCd, NiMH or dry cells). Working voltages must not exceed 24V DC (mean voltage) at any point of time. All power connections must be of an adequate grade and adequately insulated. Cables must be routed to minimize the chances of being cut. All efforts must be made to protect battery terminals from a direct shot and causing a battery fire, failure to do so will cause direct disqualification. Motors: The robot should move as fast as possible around the arena with the help of motors. DC motors and stepper motors (12V-24V) can be used as per the design of bots",

JUDGMENT CRITERIA : Judgment will be based on the time taken by the participant to complete the lap. The teams with best time will be taken into consideration and will be qualified into next round. NOTE : The filtering depends on the number of participants registered in this event. ROUND 2 ,TASK : To project the ball into the scale(slot) with maximum point. DESCRIPTION : To place the ball from ground into the water where the scales with different points  is placed. The ball will be tied to your boat by means of a hook and thread. You can move the boat in any direction so that it falls into the scale holding maximum point. You will be given three chances and points acquired in each chance will be summed up. NOTE: The means of fitting the hook to the boat should be taken care by the participant. The thread will be provided by us. JUDGMENT CRITERIA :  It will be based on the points acquired by the team in three attempts. Top four teams with maximum points will advance into the round 3 i.e., the FINAL ROUND. ROUND 3, FINAL ROUND, TASK : In this event two teams will have to compete each other. PROBLEM STATEMENT: A set of balls of two different colors will be placed randomly in the water. The competing will teams have to place the balls of their choice into their respective goal posts provided at the end of the arena. HINT: The board should be fitted with an arm (like a snow plow) which pushes the ball forward. (You can also use any other suitable mechanism which fulfils the aim of the task.) JUDGEMENT CRITERIA: The team which manages to place maximum number of balls into the post in the given time frame will be declared as winner of the event, followed by the runner-ups.
